# css-cassettes
CSS only audio cassettes tapes!

*** This project is very much in progress ***

The idea was inspired by [tapedeck.org](http://tapedeck.org) as well as my love for cassette tape design.
These particular designs were lovingly taken from [123rf.com (stock image website)](http://www.123rf.com/photo_54482438_retro-plastic-audio-cassette-music-cassette-cassette-tape-isolated-on-white-background-realistic-ill.html).

The challege is to recreate the designs linked above with HTML and CSS only. In the future I hope to add some CSS animation.
